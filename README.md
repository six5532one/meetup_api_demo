What if you could find Meetups without looking for them?

The places we visit are a part of our lifestyle and people who visit the same places share interests. There are Meetups happening at some of the places you already visit, that may be just right for you.

Serendipity is a proof-of-concept web app that discovers upcoming Meetups at a user’s current location when s/he checks in with Swarm (formerly Foursquare). It operates on the principle that the interests of other patrons of the venue can help you to discover Meetups that you hadn’t thought to seek out yourself.

In order to start this project, I used https://github.com/softprops/muxup as scaffolding.
Although the final state of this repository is quite different, the Flask templates for the web component
of this application are forked from @softprops. The 404 and 500 error handlers are also forked from his repository. 
Thanks, @softprops!
