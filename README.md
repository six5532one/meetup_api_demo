In order to start this project, I used https://github.com/softprops/muxup as scaffolding.
Although the final state of this repository is quite different, the Flask templates for the web component
of this application are forked from @softprops. The 404 and 500 error handlers are also forked from his repository. 
Thanks, @softprops!
